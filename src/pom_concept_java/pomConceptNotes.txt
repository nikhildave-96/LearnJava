There is no usage of extends nor of implements keywords inside both the classes

This java concept is the basic idea behind POM design pattern

Just create object of class of which you desire to use its methods and variables inside your testcase class

main method or testNG is necessary for using this concept  (Noted - void return type method cases only)

using object of that particular class we can access that class's methods inside our testcase class 

This concept is very useful in framework structure as we call methods from page Object class inside our testcase class
